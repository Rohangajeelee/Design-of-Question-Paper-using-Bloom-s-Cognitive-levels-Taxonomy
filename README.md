# Design-of-Question-Paper-using-Bloom-s-Cognitive-levels-Taxonomy
 Designing of question papers based on Bloom’s Cognitive  levels/Taxonomy by using Python programming language and concepts of Computer  Networking.  The project ‘Design of Question Paper using Bloom’s Cognitive levels/Taxonomy’ will  enable college authorities to automatically generate question papers out of existing question  bank. The system will have capability to process different unique sets of papers  automatically.   After the question paper has been converted to pdf file, it will be mailed to  the respective professors.   Therefore, the resultant automated system for Question Paper Generation  provides improvement in terms of controlled access to the resources, random generation of question papers and a secure platform.
